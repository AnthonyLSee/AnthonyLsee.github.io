            <h2>sum.pal</h2>
            <h3>Intelligent GroupMe Bot that will sum up or categorize previous messages beyond a fixed parameter.</h3>
            <p><b>sum.pal</b> is a tool that summarizes text messages for large group chats to make user’s lives easier.
                The main idea is this : Say you are in a large group chat, social or work, and the chat gets flooded with
                messages when you are busy. In order to catch up, the user must go back and read all the unread messages
                which could be either small as 20 texts to 100 texts. <b>sum.pal</b> is designed to fix this issue.
            </br></br><b>sum.pal</b> is coded in Python and uses GroupMe’s bot tools, a Python API called Groupy, and a summarizing algorithm found online.</p>
            <h3>Here's how it works</h3>
            <div class = "content-list">
                <p>1) sum.pal always looking at the most recent messages</p>
                <p>2) User calls @sum.pal in the groupchat</p>
                <p>3) sum.pal then grabs the most recent messages</p>
                <p>4) sum.pal concatenates all the messages together into a block of text</p>
                <p>5) sum.pal runs the block of text into the summarization algorithm</p>
                <p>6) The summarization algorithm returns a summarized block of text and gives it to sum.pal</p>
                <p>7) sum.pal prints it into the groupchat. </p>

            <h2>Multithreaded Chatroom</h2>
            <h3>^ Read the title ^</h3>
            <p>This is a project that uses multiple concepts such as multithreading,
            networking, sockets, and more. It is completely coded in C and is in terminal.
            It has two main files, the server code and client code. Each of these files
            include its own functions and code that works with the purpose of the files.</br>
            The Chatroom comes with multiple other features which includes room size,
            colored names for each user, username checking, ablitiy to see list of members, and save chat history.</p>
            <h3>Here's how it works</h3>
            <div class = "content-list">
                    <p>1) Server Code Starts, waiting for any user requests</p>
                    <p>2) User Code Starts and User inserts valid username</p>
                    <p>3) After making sure the username is clean, the User has access to the room</p>
                    <p>4) User can run commands such as @who and @exit that shows whos in the group chat and to exit respectivly</p>
            </div>
            <p>In terms of code, it uses C’s pthread library to create a thread for
                each user and waits. The client code sends a request with its username
                and socket descriptor. Server validates the info then lets the client
                continue. The server then also uses a function that creates a User Object
                / Struct based on the info the client provides, which includes the username,
                color, and socket descriptor. This User Object is inserted into a User Object
                Array, acting as its “database.”
                </br></br>There essentially two important threads, reading and writing.
                The client creates a thread that is always listening for messages,
                reading, and a thread that asks for user input, writing. When a message
                is sent, the server reads it and then uses the database and the socket
                descriptors to send the message out. The server code includes a writeToAllUsers()
                function that includes a for loop, a write function with the socket descriptor,
                and the message. It loops through all the user objects, grabbing its descriptor,
                and sends out the message. </p>

            <h2>ACS and KSA of Rutgers Camden</br>Visual Identity</h2>
            <h3>Creating a visual identity for the Asian Cultural Society and the Koreans Students Association at Rutgers Camden</h3>
            <p>For ACS, in the beginning it was more towards flat / minimalistic design.
                The graphics will emphasize the color scheme, red and white, of ACS. When I
                became president and left the PR Rep position from KSA, both ACS and my own style
                changed and developed. It was more centered around very modern and professional
                design but kept the emphasis on the red colors through red color overlays on high quality images.</p>
            <p style= "text-align:center"><i>2015-2016 and 2017-2018 aesthetic respectivly</i></p>
            <div class = "content-image-container">

                <img src="graphics/acs-example2.png">
            </div>
            </br>
            <p>For KSA, the style was a modern aesthetic that emphasizes more of the logo then any
                other element. A big idea I wanted to hit on was making the designs “cool” and “slick.”
                This is done by emphasizing the logo, by changing it to all white, which is on top of very
                modern / city images that is split in half and reflected on both sides. I was also not
                afraid to stray away from the style if the event calls for it which can be seen in KSA’s
                Star Search Designs.</p>

            <h2>"Aesthetically Average" Project</h2>
            <h3>An Instagram page demonstrating and practicing Experimental and Abstract graphics</h3>
            <p>I’ve created this page to give me an outlet for a creative and abstract direction.
                 A lot of my work prior tends to be more “professional” but AA gives me a chance to experiment
                 and expand my style. By experimenting through AA, my professional work can be expanded and in return,
                 more creative and original.</br></br>In terms of Direction, I tend to work on artistic motif
                 and apply it to my graphics for a period of time. Usually my work comes in 3s, so it's
                 generally the same graphic but represented in different ways. Some of the motifs i’ve work
                 with was photomanipulation and color channel experimentation, bold abstract shapes and vectors
                 applied to real life images, and repetitive text along with bold colors.</p>

            <h2>Walter Rand Institute of Public Affairs</br>Visual Identity</h2>
            <h3>Creating a Visual identity for the Walter Rand Institute for Public Affairs at Rutgers Camden</h3>
            <p>WRI is a rutgers department that works with public affairs ranging from
                Community and Organizational Development, Criminal Justice and Public
                Safety, and Population Health and Wellness. The core components developing
                the style is that WRI is heavily based on information and that its a Rutgers
                department.</br></br>The visual identity takes the colors and logos from the
                Rutgers Visual Identity. Nearly everything else is designed around the
                informational nature of WRI. It takes the scarlet of Rutgers and combines it with
                modern / infographic elements such as the “Block Design” element and bold san serif
                fonts. The visual identity uses a lot of negative space and hierarchy to display the
                information presented. If the designs are not using the Rutgers Scarlet, it uses white instead.</p>
