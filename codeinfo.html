            <h2>sum.pal</h2>
            <h3>Intelligent GroupMe Bot that will sum up or categorize previous messages beyond a fixed parameter.</h3>
            <p><b>sum.pal</b> is a tool that summarizes text messages for large group chats to make user’s lives easier.
                The main idea is this : Say you are in a large group chat, social or work, and the chat gets flooded with
                messages when you are busy. In order to catch up, the user must go back and read all the unread messages
                which could be either small as 20 texts to 100 texts. <b>sum.pal</b> is designed to fix this issue.
            </br></br><b>sum.pal</b> is coded in Python and uses GroupMe’s bot tools, a Python API called Groupy, and a summarizing algorithm found online.</p>
            <h3>Here's how it works</h3>
            <div class = "content-list">
                <p>1) sum.pal always looking at the most recent messages</p>
                <p>2) User calls @sum.pal in the groupchat</p>
                <p>3) sum.pal then grabs the most recent messages</p>
                <p>4) sum.pal concatenates all the messages together into a block of text</p>
                <p>5) sum.pal runs the block of text into the summarization algorithm</p>
                <p>6) The summarization algorithm returns a summarized block of text and gives it to sum.pal</p>
                <p>7) sum.pal prints it into the groupchat. </p>

            <h3>A Twitter bot that provides a diagnosis based on your message.</h3>
            <p><b>Hey_Baymax</b> is a python bot that uses Twitter’s API to diagnosis you based on the
            symptoms your provide in your tweet. Whenever a user calls on Hey_Baymax’s twitter handle,
            it then will take the message and use different algorithms and code to make a message to send back.</p>

            <h2>Multithreaded Chatroom</h2>
            <h3>^ Read the title ^</h3>
            <p>This is a project that uses multiple concepts such as multithreading,
            networking, sockets, and more. It is completely coded in C and is in terminal.
            It has two main files, the server code and client code. Each of these files
            include its own functions and code that works with the purpose of the files.</br>
            The Chatroom comes with multiple other features which includes room size,
            colored names for each user, username checking, ablitiy to see list of members, and save chat history.</p>
            <h3>Here's how it works</h3>
            <div class = "content-list">
                    <p>1) Server Code Starts, waiting for any user requests</p>
                    <p>2) User Code Starts and User inserts valid username</p>
                    <p>3) After making sure the username is clean, the User has access to the room</p>
                    <p>4) User can run commands such as @who and @exit that shows whos in the group chat and to exit respectivly</p>
            </div>
            <p>In terms of code, it uses C’s pthread library to create a thread for
                each user and waits. The client code sends a request with its username
                and socket descriptor. Server validates the info then lets the client
                continue. The server then also uses a function that creates a User Object
                / Struct based on the info the client provides, which includes the username,
                color, and socket descriptor. This User Object is inserted into a User Object
                Array, acting as its “database.”
                </br></br>There essentially two important threads, reading and writing.
                The client creates a thread that is always listening for messages,
                reading, and a thread that asks for user input, writing. When a message
                is sent, the server reads it and then uses the database and the socket
                descriptors to send the message out. The server code includes a writeToAllUsers()
                function that includes a for loop, a write function with the socket descriptor,
                and the message. It loops through all the user objects, grabbing its descriptor,
                and sends out the message. </p>
